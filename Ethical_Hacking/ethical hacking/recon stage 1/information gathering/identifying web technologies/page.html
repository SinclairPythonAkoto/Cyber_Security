</head><body><b><u>Identifying Web Technologies</u></b><br/>
<br/>
This is geared more towards when doing recon on a website, a useful bit of information would be the tech stack used to craete the website. &nbsp;If you can find out the tech stack then you could find out maybe the version of the stack. &nbsp;You could be able to find any bugs or issues with the version and use that as a possible exploit. &nbsp;<i>This tyoe of apporach would not be the magic bullet to your problem but it would help you in your quest to gtehr as much data as possible</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>buildwith.com</b><br/>
Enter the domain that you want to search for and it will tell you the tech stack about the site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Wappalyzer - Firefox</b><br/>
In your <i>virtual machine</i>&nbsp;Google and download <b>Wappalyzer</b>&nbsp;for Firefox. &nbsp;With Wappalyzer, when you are browsing websites it has an inetractive tool that analyses what tech stack is being used. &nbsp;It has a <i>pop up</i>&nbsp;at the <b>corner of the screen</b>&nbsp;where you can click and <b>check on the tech stack of the page</b>.<br/>
<br/>

<i>When we click on the icon we get to see all the different tech stacks being used</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>whatweb</b><br/>
This is another tool at our disposal that we can use to gather information on a website. &nbsp;This is built into Kali Linux so we just need to use whatweb follwoed by the domain name.<br/>
<br/>
<tt>whatweb tesla.com</tt><br/>

You can see you get a all types of information of the website<br/>
<br/>
If we look closely we can see the the website's <b>IP address from the different parts locations</b>, you can see the <b>operating system</b>&nbsp;(which is <b>Drupal</b>), you can see what <b>languages are used in the scripts</b>&nbsp;amongst other things.<br/>
