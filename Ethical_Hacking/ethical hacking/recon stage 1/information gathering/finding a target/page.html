</head><body><b><u>Identifying A Target</u></b><br/>
<br/>
Before you begin the most obvious thing is to identify who or what you will target.<br/>
<br/>
For the course we will use Bug Crowd. &nbsp;It is a website that allows you to hack a list of their programs and get a reward if you find any bugs or security flaws.<br/>
<br/>
<tt>www.bugcrowd.com/programs</tt><br/>
<br/>
Search for <b>Tesla</b>&nbsp;in the seach box.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Read the program details o make sure you can stay in scope.<br/>
<br/>
</b>It will tell you which sites to avoid and which sites you can pen-test.<br/>
