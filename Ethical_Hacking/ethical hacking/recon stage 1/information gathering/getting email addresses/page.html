<title>Getting Email Addresses</title>
</head><body><b><u>Discovering Email Addresses</u></b><br/>
<br/>
We will look at some of the tools used to look up email addresses and find people.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine we want to get in contact with someone in a company, we have looked them up in their company website but <br/>
there is no direct email address. &nbsp;In this section we will look at how we would be able to retrieve an email address in this scenario.<br/>
<br/>
<b>hunter.io</b><br/>
You enter the name of the company to check if the format of the company's email. &nbsp;With the format of the company email address, we can then use that to create our email. &nbsp;To use the website we need to sign up - <b>it's free</b>.<br/>
<br/>
In our Kali Linux go to <b>hunter.io</b>&nbsp;then <i>sign up</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>phonebook.cz</b><br/>
You enter the domain name then choose if its emails, domains or URLs you are searching for. &nbsp;The app will return a list of results.<br/>
<br/>
This is <b>totolly free</b>&nbsp;without the need to sign up.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clearbit</b><br/>
Is a Google extension that can find people's email address within a company. &nbsp;You have to use it with Google Chrome.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Email Hippo</b><br/>
Use this to verify if an email exists. &nbsp;It will return an <tt>OK</tt>&nbsp;or <tt>Bad</tt>&nbsp;result. &nbsp;Find the wibsite at <tt>tools.verifyemailaddress.io</tt>.<br/>
<br/>
You can also use <tt>email-checker.net/validate</tt>&nbsp;which is a different website to <i>Email Hippo</i>&nbsp;with the same type of service.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>REMEMBER !!</b><br/>
<ul><li>If you have a target's email, you can click forgot password. &nbsp;Sites like Google will show you snippets of the email where they will send the verification code to. &nbsp;With that you can try to crack the users email.</li>
</ul>
