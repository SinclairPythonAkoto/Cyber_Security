<title>Passive Recon</title>
</head><body><b><u>Passive Recon Overview<br/>
</u></b><br/>
This is a diagram to show the different examples of passive recon. &nbsp;Passive recon is when we gather data from public information that is already out there.<br/>

You may be tasked with a physical assessment so these are the type of things you would look for.<br/>
<br/>
<b>This is a quick overview of how we would recon a web / host address which we will cover in the course.</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>Target Validation</b><ul><li>First thing is to validate your target address - this is the correct address for the target?</li>
<li>If your are given an incorrect address you can validate the address before you start any exploits.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Finding Subdomains</b><ul><li>Use tools like Google Fu &amp; Nmap to browse for subdomians - more will be covered in the course</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Fingerprinting</b>&nbsp;<ul><li>What is running on a website / host? &nbsp;What type of services are out there</li>
<li>If they are running a web server what version is it?</li>
<li>What ports do they have open on their machine?</li>
<li>Do they have any ports open?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Data Breaches</b><ul><li>The most common external way to get into networks</li>
<li>Cover breached incidents from the past that have leaked data </li>
<li>Use data dumps to get access </li>
</ul>

The better your information gathering and scanning/enumeration skills are, the better pen-tester you will be! &nbsp;It is really important to master the <b>first 2 stages</b>&nbsp;of the<b>&nbsp;5 stages of ethical hacking</b>.</body></html>
