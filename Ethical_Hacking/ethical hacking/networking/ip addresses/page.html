This returns two types of IP addresses - <i>IPV4</i>&nbsp;&amp; <i>IPV6. &nbsp;</i>The common IP address that is used for IPV4 is <i>inet</i>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>IPV4 Address</b><br/>

<br/>
IPV6 uses <i>inet6</i>&nbsp;which is a newer version of the IP address.<br/>
<br/>
<b>IPV6 Address</b><br/>

<i><br/>
</i>The IP addresses communicate over <i>Layer 3</i>&nbsp;(from the <b>OSI Model</b>)<br/>
<ul><li>The IP address has 8 bits for each numerical value </li>
<li>This means that the IP address has 4x 8 bits to make up the whole IP address number</li>
<li>The IP address will have <b>32 bits</b>&nbsp;(4x 8 bits), which is the same as <b>4 bytes</b></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<u><b>IPV4 vs IPV6</b></u><ul><li>With an IPV4 we have 4.29B different IP addresses by multiplying 2 to the power of 32 (32 bits).</li>
<li>With IPV6 we have a larger range of IP addresses because we are multiplying 2 to the power of 128 (128 bits). &nbsp;This gives us 3.402...e+38 (which is a lot!)</li>
<li>The IPV4 addresses are all full, but they are still being used because of <b>NAT (Network Address Translation)</b>. &nbsp;They give us private IP address which can host many networks across a public IP address.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<u><b>Private IP addresses</b></u><br/>
<br/>
These below are the different <i>private IP addresses</i>&nbsp;at our disposal.<br/>
<br/>
<b>192.168</b>&nbsp; - IP addresses that are for small networks (like your home or small business)<br/>
<br/>
A <b>Class A</b>&nbsp;or <b>Class B</b>&nbsp;address is used for bigger buisnesses in order to host more netowrks. &nbsp;Small buisnesses can also use these IP addresses.<br/>

<br/>
As you can see, you one private IP address can have potentially millions of networks, with each network allowing hundreds (sometimes thousands or millions) of hosts on each network.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Small buisnesses and coorperations will use 10.0.0.0 addresses becasue it will give them millions of hosts on each network, but will have fewer networks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>REMEMBER!!</b><br/>
</i><ul><li>IPV4 &amp; IPV6 addresses are <b>Layer 3 protocols</b></li>
<li><b>A router</b>&nbsp;is a <i>Layer 3 protocol</i></li>
<li>All your network traffic goes through <b>1x IP address</b></li>
<li>IPV4 uses NAT to contain <b>multiple networks and multiple hosts</b>&nbsp;for each network for each <b>private IP address</b></li>
</ul>
