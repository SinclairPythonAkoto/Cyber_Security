<b>Reconnaissance</b><ul><li>Information gathering </li>
<li>Active reconnaissance is when we get data directily from the target</li>
<li>Passive is like looking up your target via Google, getting data from public profiles</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Scanning &amp; Enumeration</b><ul><li>Looking at items to find anything of value</li>
<li>You may find something that you can then research on to find exploits for</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Gaining Access</b><ul><li>Run an exploitation against our target (client, host, server ect)</li>
<li>We are trying to gain access to a network, machine, environment etc</li>
<li>Once we have gained access, we will want to do some further reconnaissance, enumeration &amp; exploits</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Maintaining Access</b><ul><li>How to maintain access to the network even if the target turns off their machine </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Covering tracks</b><ul><li>Get rid of any logs </li>
<li>Might want to remove any malware, or any accounts you may have created</li>
<li>Cleaning up ater your pen-test or covering up your tracks so your exploit stays hide</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<br/>
This course will heavily focus on stages 1 - 3 and briefly cover the final two stages.<br/>
