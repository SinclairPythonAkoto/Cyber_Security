<br/>
<br/>
In this section we will cover what a network is and the fundermentals.<br/>
<br/>

<i>Diagram of a network</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>What is a network?</b><ul><li>A digital telecommications network that allows nodes to share data/communicate</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Below are some of the different nodes that you will find in a network, we will explain what they all do later.<br/>
<br/>

<i>Example of network nodes</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Building a Network</b><br/>
We will gradually build our network from scratch, so we can undertand the different network nodes and the role they play.<br/>
<br/>
If we connect two computers togther with a cable then have a <i>(very basic)</i>&nbsp;<b>network</b>! &nbsp;With the two computers connecte, this allows them to be able to communicate to eachother.<br/>
<br/>

<i>Computers that are connected to eachother creates a network</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clients &amp; Servers</b><br/>
We wil cover the definition of a client and a server, and also show some examples of what they look like.<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><b>Client</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">Is a device that access a service made by a server</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><img src="image 4.png" /></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><i>Example of clients</i></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><b>Server</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">A device that provides functions or services for clients</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><img src="image 5.png" /></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><i>Example of servers</i></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Your desktop can also be a server</b>; if we look at the building a netowork image we can say one PC is the server and the other is the client. &nbsp;For example, if a computer was sending a file to anotehr, the computer <b>recieving the file would be the client</b>, and the computer <b>sending the file would be the server</b>.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
</i><b>Switches</b><br/>
We will look at what switches are and how they are used within a network.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 9.png" /><br/>
<i>These are Cisco entrprise grade switches and are used by many enterprises</i><br/>
<br/>
Because we <b><i>do not</i></b>&nbsp;directly connect our clients and servers to each other, we use switches to act as the <b>middleman</b>&nbsp;between the connections. &nbsp;They have the ability to host <b>multiple connections</b>&nbsp;becuase most switches usually <b>have over 24 ports</b>&nbsp;and they can accommondate both connectivity and hosting for the end host (clients &amp; servers).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 10.png" /><br/>
<i>Switches can house multiple connections for clients and servers</i><br/>
<br/>
Switches forward the traffic of the end hosts within a <b>LAN (Local Area Network)</b>. &nbsp;This is basically a <b>bunch of end hosts/devices that are on the same area</b>&nbsp;- this <i>could be the same office floor, the entire office (if it was small), or even your LAN at home</i>. &nbsp;Devices that are connected to the switch will be able to communicate with eachother; however switches cannot communicate with other switches across the internet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 11.png" /><br/>
<i>Switches can only communicate to devices in the same local network</i><br/>
<br/>
As you can see switches can only has access to devices in the same network. &nbsp;In order to connect to other devices, like for the New York branch to connect to the Tokyo branch they would need a <b>router</b>&nbsp;to communicate over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Catalyst switches are Cisco's enterprise grade switches which are used by many enterprises to connect their LANs.</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Routers</b><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 12.png" /><br/>
<i>Typical Cisco ISR enterprise routers</i><br/>
<br/>
Routers provide <b>connectivity between other switches over the internet</b>. &nbsp;They have <b>less ports</b>&nbsp;than switches and some can be found at the front of the device or at the back of the device. &nbsp;The routers in this image are <i>Cisco enterprise routers</i>&nbsp;that provides connections between other LANs. &nbsp;<b>This allows data to be sent across the internet</b>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 13.png" /><br/>
<i>Routers allow LANs/switches to comminucate over the internet</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Firewalls</b><br/>
There are two types of firewalls: <b>host-based firewalls</b>&nbsp;and <b>network firewalls</b>.<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><b>Host-Based Firewalls</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><i>Software applications that fileter traffic entering and exiting the host machine (like a PC, laptrop, etc). &nbsp;Most PCs have built in firewalls.</i></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><b>Network Firewalls</b></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><i>Hardware devices that control network traffic entering &amp; leaving the network.</i></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
In this course we will focus on <u><b>network firewalls</b></u>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 14.png" /><br/>
<i>Cisco 'Next-Generation' network firewalls</i><br/>
<br/>
The images above shows you what a typical <i>'Next-Generation'</i>&nbsp;Cisco firewall looks like. &nbsp;Older models like the <b>ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance)</b>&nbsp;is Cisco's classic model while the two in the image are <i>Next-Gen</i>&nbsp;because they come with extra security features like an <b>IPS (Instrusion Prevention System)</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Firewalls monitor and control netwrok traffic based on <b>configured security rules</b>&nbsp;that tells them which traffic to accept or deny. &nbsp;These firewalls can be placed inside or outside of the netwrok, to protect the end hosts within (eg PCs &amp; servers etc).<br/>
<b>This means firewalls are not directly connected to the end host.</b><br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 15.png" /><br/>
<i>The firewall protects end hosts in both New York &amp; Tokyo</i><br/>
<br/>
If configured properly, the PCs from New York will be able to access the servers from Tokyo and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="image 16.png" /><br/>
<i>You configure which end hosts are allowed access to the network</i><br/>
<br/>
It will also <b>block anyone outside of the network</b>&nbsp;trying to access the PCs in New York or servers in Tokyo.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>

<i>Protects the network from outsiders</i><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>REMEMBER !! </b><br/>
<ul><li>A <i>host</i>&nbsp;can refer to any type of <b>network node</b>.</li>
<li>A <b>client access/recieves</b>&nbsp;a service, while a <b>server provides</b>&nbsp;the service.</li>
<li>The same device can be a <i>server</i>&nbsp;is some situations, <b>and</b>&nbsp;a <i>client</i>&nbsp;in other situations.</li>
<li>Cisco's enterprise grade <i>switches</i>&nbsp;which are used by many enterprises to<b>&nbsp;connect to their LANs</b>.</li>
<li><i>LANs</i>&nbsp;are <i>local area networks</i>&nbsp;that provide <b>connectivity to local devices</b>.</li>
<li><i>Routers</i>&nbsp;allow <b>communication between LANs/switches</b>. &nbsp;They also <b>allow data to be sent</b>&nbsp;to other devices this way.</li>
<li><i>Routers</i>&nbsp;have <b>less ports</b>&nbsp;than <i>switches</i>.</li>
<li>There are <b>two</b>&nbsp;types of firewalls, <b>host-based firewalls</b>&nbsp;&amp; <b>network firewalls</b>.</li>
<li><i>Network firewalls</i>&nbsp;<b>control traffic</b>&nbsp;within the network. It <b>stops</b>&nbsp;outsiders from accessing the network.</li>
<li>Firewalls can also connect to <b>multiple networks</b>.</li>
<li>There are <b>more</b>&nbsp;network devices which we will cover!</li>
